# MEDCORE — Contract Change Requests

A **contract change** is any change that affects behavior another agent relies
on: editing a shared/contract file (see `AGENTS.md` §4), adding a new `RoleKey`,
changing an existing endpoint's request/response shape, changing a shared table,
or defining a cross-workstream event/read contract.

**Not** a contract change (do it directly in your own files): adding a new
permission and granting it to an existing role in your `permissions.<workstream>.ts`;
adding a new event type in your `events.<workstream>.ts`; adding a new endpoint
inside your own feature module; adding a new table in your migration range.

## Process

1. Copy the template below to the top of the "Requests" list.
2. Assign the next `CCR-NNN` id, set **Status: PROPOSED**.
3. Agent 1 reviews. Approved → **APPROVED** (+ who implements the shared part).
   Rejected → **REJECTED** with a reason and an alternative.
4. Dependent work starts only after **APPROVED** and the shared part is merged.
5. When merged, set **Status: DONE**.

## Template

```
### CCR-NNN — <short title>

- Requested by: Agent N
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Affects: <agents / workstreams>
- Contract file(s): <paths>
- Change: <what changes, precisely>
- Reason: <why it is needed>
- Backward compatibility: <migration/compat plan; how existing callers keep working>
- Tests: <what proves it safe>
- Decision (Agent 1): <notes>
```

## Known contracts to respect (baseline, do not break)

- **API error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details?" } }` with
  stable `code` values; success bodies are the resource JSON.
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; principal carries `clinicId`,
  `roles`, `permissions`. Every protected route runs `requireAuth`, every
  service asserts a permission and scopes by `clinic_id`.
- **QR payload:** `MEDCORE1:<opaque-base64url>`; NEVER contains PHI.
- **Audit vs events:** sensitive actions → append-only `audit_log` (no PHI in
  metadata); domain facts → append-only `event`, emitted in the same
  transaction as the state change.
- **DB conventions:** every tenant table has `clinic_id`; timestamps are
  `timestamptz`; `audit_log` and `event` reject UPDATE/DELETE.
- **Governance boundaries:** pharma gets no patient-identifiable data; AI output
  is review-first and never auto-writes clinical records.
